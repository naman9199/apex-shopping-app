if you get the warning for multiple "Invariant Violation: Tried to register two views with the same name RNCSafeAreaProvider error with @react-navigation/stack"

-> run "npm dedupe"

for Timer warning: 

-> Go to node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Core/Timer/JSTimers.js

-> Look for the variable MAX_TIMER_DURATION_MS

-> Change 60 * 1000 to 10000 * 1000 , needed for firebase

this is because using setTimeout() with a big timeout duration (as we're setting it => 1 hour), can't be handled in the most efficient way by Android.
